# //////numpy drives 2 words num and py num means numurical and py means python

# -------NumPy is a library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays. Wikipedia
# -------Written in: Python, C
# -------Developer(s): Community project
# -------Original author(s): Travis Oliphant
# -------Stable release: 1.20.3 / 10 May 2021; 2 months ago
# -------Initial release: As Numeric, 1995; as NumPy, 2006

# /////when we want to handle data in numarical form than we use numpy library of python

# /////this is basically in the form of list

# ////numpy definition------
# (.)numpy is scientific computing library for python
# (.)support large number of data in the form of multi-dimentional array and matrix
# (.)use for mathematics calculation like linear algebra, Fourier transform, random number capability,etc.
# ////it is handle with the help of list -----one dimentional array(vector), two dimentional array(matrix), multi dimentional array(numpy)
# ///we receiving the data as a images and than we perform it using arrays
# //// python don't understand the images
# ////first of all we take a images than it is converted to grance image than we convered to numaric form than we converted to array form
# //// numpy is a tool to take a pictures and than convereted to array form and than to output
# /////this is the tool to install numpy
# /////////////pip install numpy
# /////than we use in the project------- import numpy as np
# ///// first of all we import the numpy than using numpy we creat array(1d,2d,3d) and than we print it




# //////why we use numpy
# //////In Python we have lists that serve the purpose of arrays, but they are slow to process.
# //////NumPy aims to provide an array object that is up to 50x faster than traditional Python lists.
# //////The array object in NumPy is called ndarray, it provides a lot of supporting functions that make working with ndarray very easy.
# //////Arrays are very frequently used in data science, where speed and resources are very important.
